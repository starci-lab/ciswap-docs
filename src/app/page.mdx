# Getting Started with CiSwap

Welcome to **CiSwap** — the first virtual AMM on Aptos that uses **synthetic liquidity** to simulate deep liquidity pools with zero initial TVL. Whether you're a DeFi power user or a curious beginner, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.

## 🧩 What is CiSwap?

CiSwap is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Aptos. It uses a unique mechanism called **virtual liquidity**, powered by internal **ciTokens**, to let users trade, provide liquidity, earn fees, and participate in DeFi—all without needing massive reserves of real assets.

### CiSwap offers:
- 🔁 **Swapping** between real and synthetic tokens
- 💧 **Adding liquidity** to earn fees
- 🏦 **Staking** synthetic tokens for rewards
- 📈 **Redeeming** synthetic tokens at a premium (e.g., 1.25x)
- 💸 **Lending/Borrowing** ciTokens
- 💰 **Claiming trading fees** from the protocol

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

To start using CiSwap, make sure you have the following:

1. ✅ An **Aptos-compatible wallet** (e.g., Petra, Martian, Pontem)
2. ✅ Some testnet **APT** or supported tokens (faucets available)
3. ✅ Access to the **CiSwap Testnet UI** → [https://ciswap.starci.net](https://ciswap.starci.net)

> 💡 You can experiment safely on Testnet before the mainnet launch.

## ⚙️ How It Works (In Simple Terms)

Unlike traditional AMMs that require deep real liquidity, CiSwap simulates depth using synthetic tokens (`ciTokens`). These are minted internally by the protocol and reflect virtual balances.

### Virtual AMM Formula:
```math
(X + ciX)(Y + ciY) = K
```
Where:
- `X`, `Y` = real token reserves
- `ciX`, `ciY` = synthetic token reserves
- `K` = constant product

This hybrid model lets trades happen even if there's little to no real liquidity in the pool.

## 🔁 How to Swap Tokens

Swapping on CiSwap is simple and flexible. Here's how it works:

1. **Go to the Swap tab** on the interface.
2. **Select token pair** (e.g., APT → ciUSDC).
3. **Enter the amount** you want to trade.
4. **Confirm slippage tolerance** (recommended: 0.5% to 1%).
5. **Click Swap** and approve the transaction.

### What you receive:
- ✅ A portion in **real token** (e.g., USDC)
- ✅ A portion in **ciToken** (e.g., ciUSDC)

These ciTokens can later be staked, redeemed, or used within the CiSwap ecosystem.

## 💧 How to Add Liquidity

Liquidity providers (LPs) are essential to the CiSwap ecosystem. When you provide liquidity, you deposit tokens into a pool and earn fees from swaps.

### To add liquidity:
1. Go to the **Liquidity tab**
2. Choose a pool (e.g., APT/ciUSDC)
3. Enter how much of each token to provide
4. Confirm and approve the transaction

### What you get:
- 📄 LP tokens that track your share of the pool
- 💰 A share of the **0.3% trading fee** on each swap
- 📈 Exposure to price and virtual liquidity growth

---

## 💰 Understanding Fees

CiSwap uses a simple but fair fee structure:
- **0.3% LP fee** on all swaps
- **10% protocol fee** taken from the LP fee (not the total swap)
  - This means 0.03% goes to the protocol
  - The remaining 0.27% goes to LPs

These fees are split between real and synthetic tokens and can be **claimed anytime**.

## 🎁 How to Earn with ciTokens

When you receive ciTokens from swaps, you're not stuck with them — in fact, they’re designed to earn more.

| Action              | Benefit                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Swap tokens       | Receive ciTokens                        |
| 📊 Stake ciTokens    | Earn protocol rewards                   |
| 💵 Redeem ciTokens   | Get up to 1.25x of face value           |
| 🏦 Lend/Borrow       | Use ciTokens for DeFi activities        |

> Think of ciTokens as yield-bearing receipts you can use across the ecosystem.

## 🔐 Slippage & Safety

To protect users, every swap on CiSwap includes **slippage tolerance**:
- You always define a minimum amount you expect.
- If the output falls below that, the transaction fails.

Also:
- ✅ All smart contracts are **on-chain & transparent**
- 🔒 Audits are underway (testnet phase)
- 🛡️ Fee logic ensures protocol sustainability

## 🧪 Try CiSwap on Testnet

👉 Test it live: [https://ciswap.starci.net](https://ciswap.starci.net)

Use your wallet to connect and explore:
- Swap APT ↔ ciUSDC
- Add liquidity to any pool
- View your synthetic balances and LP fees

> 📢 Testnet is an open playground — experiment freely before mainnet.

## 📌 Final Notes

- ciTokens are internal synthetic assets, not bridged or backed by real-world collateral.
- They can be redeemed for extra value, depending on protocol rules.
- The long-term vision of CiSwap is to enable **capital-efficient trading** with **zero initial TVL**.
