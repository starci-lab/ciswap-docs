    # 🔁 Swap (Deep Dive for Users)

Swapping on CiSwap is not just a standard token-for-token trade. It's powered by virtual liquidity, so the result of your swap is **split** between real and synthetic assets.

## 🎯 What Happens During a Swap?
When you initiate a swap, you're trading a real token (e.g., APT) for a mix of real and synthetic tokens (ciTokens). The smart contract calculates the output using a hybrid constant product formula:

```math
(X + ciX)(Y + ciY) = K
```

This formula ensures that liquidity is simulated, allowing trades to execute even if the real reserves are low. You receive a combination of:

- ✅ **Real tokens** (if available in reserves)
- ✅ **ciTokens** (synthetic assets minted by the protocol)

> Example: Swap 100 APT → 25 USDC (real) + 75 ciUSDC (synthetic)

## 📊 How It Works Internally
When the `swap()` function is called in Move:

1. **Validation**:
   - Checks that `amount_in > 0`
   - Ensures sufficient balance for input token

2. **AMM Calculation**:
   - Computes output amounts (`amount_out`, `amount_debt_out`) using both real and synthetic reserves
   - Calculates swap fees (split between LP and protocol)

3. **Slippage Protection**:
   - Validates that outputs are greater than user-defined minimums

4. **Token Transfers**:
   - Transfers real input tokens to the pool
   - Transfers real output tokens to the recipient
   - Transfers synthetic output tokens to the recipient
   - Applies fee extraction logic

5. **Fee Distribution**:
   - 90% of fees to LP fee stores
   - 10% of fees to protocol fee stores
   - Fee accounting separated for real and synthetic tokens

6. **Reserve Update**:
   - Adjusts reserves for both real and synthetic tokens based on trade

7. **Emit Event**:
   - Emits a `SwapEvent` with metadata: sender, amount, direction, recipient, output amounts

## 🧠 What Makes It Unique
- ✨ Dual output: Get both real and synthetic tokens
- 🛡️ Safety: Slippage limits prevent loss
- 🔄 Composable: ciTokens can be staked, lent, or redeemed

## ⚠️ Notes
- If real liquidity is low, most of your output may be synthetic
- Real token output is capped by pool reserve
- ciTokens are fully trackable and claimable in future
