# ðŸ’§ Manage Liquidity (Overview for Users)

In CiSwap, users can manage liquidity through four key actions:

### âž• Add Liquidity
- Provide token X and Y to a selected pool
- The protocol calculates the **optimal deposit ratio** based on reserves
- Youâ€™ll receive an **LP NFT** that represents your ownership share

### ðŸ”¼ Increase Liquidity
- Add more tokens to an existing LP position using your LP NFT
- Boosts your pool share and potential fee earnings

### ðŸ”½ Decrease Liquidity
- Temporarily withdraw part of your liquidity without closing the position
- Useful for risk adjustment or portfolio balancing

### âž– Remove Liquidity
- Fully exit a position and burn the LP NFT
- Youâ€™ll receive real tokens and ciTokens based on your share and pool state

## ðŸ“ˆ Virtual Liquidity Advantages
Virtual liquidity enables:

- ðŸ“‰ **Reduced Impermanent Loss**: By including ciTokens in the swap and liquidity logic, exposure is balanced
- ðŸš€ **Capital Efficiency**: Pools function even with limited real liquidity, enabling earlier launch and scale
- ðŸ’Ž **Composability**: ciTokens are usable in lending, staking, or redemption protocols

> Note: All liquidity positions are NFT-based and non-fungible â€” enabling fine-grained, personalized yield management.
