# 🧱 Redeem, Stake, Lend Debt Tokens

ciTokens (such as ciAPT, ciUSDC) are synthetic representations of liquidity. Once received from a swap or liquidity event, they become powerful composable assets.

## 🔄 Redeem (1.25x Boost)
- Users can **redeem ciTokens** for real tokens at a boosted rate of **up to 1.25x**, depending on protocol reserves and time locked.
- This boost encourages users to hold ciTokens longer and align with the system's health.
- Some redemptions may require a waiting period or vesting mechanism.

## 📥 Stake
- Stake your ciTokens into staking vaults.
- Earn staking rewards in the form of protocol fees or incentive tokens.
- Some pools may offer boosted yields for ciToken staking.

## 💸 Lend
- Supply ciTokens to lending markets.
- Borrowers can use them as collateral or borrow other ciTokens/real tokens.
- Interest rates are determined by market demand and risk.

## 🧠 Why Use ciTokens?
- 🔄 Utility across the protocol: swapping, staking, redeeming, lending
- 💡 Potential yield generation while waiting for redemption
- 🔐 Flexible usage in multiple DeFi primitives

> In the future, ciTokens may also integrate with external protocols, expanding their DeFi utility.
